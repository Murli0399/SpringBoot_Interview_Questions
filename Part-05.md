### What is the purpose of @Component annotation?
</summary>
The @Component annotation is a fundamental part of the Spring Framework, which is a popular Java-based framework for building enterprise applications. The purpose of the @Component annotation is to indicate that a class is a component or a bean in the Spring context.

When a class is annotated with @Component, it is automatically detected and registered by the Spring container during the component scanning process. The Spring container then creates an instance of the class and manages its lifecycle, allowing it to be injected into other parts of the application.

By using the @Component annotation, you can define reusable and manageable components in your application. These components can be automatically wired together, configured, and controlled by the Spring container, enabling dependency injection and inversion of control (IOC) principles.

The @Component annotation is a generic stereotype annotation, which means it serves as the base annotation for more specific stereotypes like @Service, @Repository, and @Controller. These specialized annotations are typically used to provide additional semantic meaning to the components based on their roles in the application architecture.

In summary, the @Component annotation is used to mark a class as a Spring component, allowing it to be managed and utilized by the Spring container for dependency injection and other application-wide features.

### What is the difference between @Component, @Service, @Repository, and @Controller?
</summary>
In the Spring Framework, @Component, @Service, @Repository, and @Controller are stereotype annotations that provide additional semantic meaning to the components in your application. Although all of them are derived from the @Component annotation, they have distinct purposes and are typically used in different layers of an application.

### 1. @Component:

- It is a generic stereotype annotation.
- It is used to mark a class as a Spring component or bean.
- It can be used for any general-purpose component in the application.
- It is typically used for utility classes, helper classes, or generic components.

### 2. @Service:

- It is a specialization of @Component.
- It is used to mark a class as a service component.
- It represents the service layer of an application, which typically contains the business logic.
- It encapsulates the application's business operations and provides services to other layers or components.
- It often orchestrates the interaction between multiple repositories or external systems.

### 3. @Repository:

- It is also a specialization of @Component.
- It is used to mark a class as a repository component.
- It represents the data access layer of an application.
- It typically encapsulates the logic to interact with the database or other external data sources.
- It provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and data access methods.

### 4. @Controller:

- It is another specialization of @Component.
- It is used to mark a class as a controller component.
- It represents the presentation layer of an application.
- It handles user requests, performs request processing, and returns responses.
- It is commonly used in web applications and typically exposes RESTful endpoints or web pages.

While these annotations serve different purposes and have different names, they all ultimately function as components managed by the Spring container. The distinction between them is mostly for clarity and semantic understanding of their roles in the application architecture. However, from a technical perspective, they are all handled in a similar way by Spring's component scanning and dependency injection mechanisms.

### Why is @Primary annotation used?
</summary>
The @Primary annotation is used in the Spring Framework to indicate a primary bean when multiple beans of the same type are present in the application context. It is used to resolve ambiguity when autowiring or injecting dependencies.

When you have more than one bean of the same type, Spring may encounter a situation where it cannot determine which bean to inject into a particular dependency. In such cases, you can use the @Primary annotation to specify a primary bean.

Here's how it works:

### Multiple Beans of the Same Type:
Let's say you have multiple beans implementing the same interface or extending the same class. For example, you may have two implementations of an interface ExampleInterface: BeanA and BeanB.
```
public interface ExampleInterface {
    // ...
}

@Component
@Primary
public class BeanA implements ExampleInterface {
    // ...
}

@Component
public class BeanB implements ExampleInterface {
    // ...
}
```
### Autowiring with @Autowired:
If you have a dependent class that requires an instance of ExampleInterface, you can use the @Autowired annotation to inject it.
```
@Component
public class DependentClass {

    @Autowired
    private ExampleInterface exampleInterface;
    
    // ...
}
```
### Resolving Ambiguity with @Primary:
In this scenario, since you have multiple beans of the same type, Spring may not know which one to inject. To specify the primary bean, you can use the @Primary annotation on BeanA.
```
@Component
@Primary
public class BeanA implements ExampleInterface {
    // ...
}
```
Now, when Spring encounters the @Autowired annotation for ExampleInterface in the DependentClass, it will inject BeanA because it is marked as the primary bean. If you remove the @Primary annotation from BeanA, Spring will throw an exception indicating that it cannot determine which bean to inject.

The @Primary annotation simplifies the resolution of bean dependencies in situations where there are multiple beans of the same type. It provides a clear indication to Spring about the primary bean to be used for injection.

### Why is @Qualifier annotation used?
</summary>
The @Qualifier annotation is used in the Spring Framework to resolve ambiguity when multiple beans of the same type are present and the @Primary annotation is not sufficient to determine the desired bean to inject. It allows for more fine-grained control over the selection of beans by specifying a qualifier value.

When you have multiple beans of the same type, Spring may encounter a situation where it cannot determine which bean to inject into a particular dependency. In such cases, you can use the @Qualifier annotation to provide additional information to Spring for bean resolution.

Here's how it works:

### 1. Multiple Beans of the Same Type:
Let's say you have multiple beans implementing the same interface or extending the same class. For example, you may have two implementations of an interface ExampleInterface: BeanA and BeanB.
```
public interface ExampleInterface {
    // ...
}

@Component
public class BeanA implements ExampleInterface {
    // ...
}

@Component
public class BeanB implements ExampleInterface {
    // ...
}
```
### 2. Autowiring with @Autowired and @Qualifier:
If you have a dependent class that requires an instance of ExampleInterface, you can use the @Autowired annotation along with the @Qualifier annotation to specify the desired bean.
```
@Component
public class DependentClass {

    @Autowired
    @Qualifier("beanA")
    private ExampleInterface exampleInterface;
    
    // ...
}
```
### 3. Specifying Qualifier Values with @Qualifier:
In this scenario, you can use the @Qualifier annotation and provide a qualifier value that matches the desired bean's qualifier value. You can assign a qualifier value to each bean using the @Qualifier annotation.
```
@Component
@Qualifier("beanA")
public class BeanA implements ExampleInterface {
    // ...
}

@Component
@Qualifier("beanB")
public class BeanB implements ExampleInterface {
    // ...
}
```
Now, when Spring encounters the @Autowired annotation for ExampleInterface in the DependentClass, it will inject BeanA because the @Qualifier annotation specifies the qualifier value as "beanA". If you change the @Qualifier value to "beanB", Spring will inject BeanB instead.

The @Qualifier annotation is useful when @Primary is not sufficient to determine the desired bean for injection. It allows you to provide additional information to Spring for resolving bean dependencies. By assigning qualifier values to beans and using the @Qualifier annotation in the dependent class, you can precisely control which bean gets injected.

### Which annotations takes precedence: @Primary or @Qualifier?
</summary>
When resolving bean dependencies in the Spring Framework, the @Qualifier annotation takes precedence over @Primary.

Here's how the precedence works:

### 1. When @Qualifier is used without @Primary:

- If the @Qualifier annotation is used on a dependency, Spring looks for a bean with a matching qualifier value specified in the @Qualifier.
- If a bean with the matching qualifier value is found, it is injected, regardless of whether it is marked as @Primary or not.
- If no bean with the matching qualifier value is found, Spring tries to inject the primary bean (if one is defined using @Primary).

### 2. When both @Qualifier and @Primary are used together:

- If the @Qualifier annotation is used with a specific qualifier value and the primary bean is also defined with @Primary, the bean matching the qualifier value will be injected, regardless of whether it is the primary bean or not.
- If the @Qualifier annotation is used without a specific qualifier value and the primary bean is defined, the primary bean will be injected.
- If the @Qualifier annotation is used without a specific qualifier value and no primary bean is defined, an exception will be thrown because Spring cannot determine which bean to inject.

In summary, the @Qualifier annotation takes precedence over @Primary when both are used together. The @Qualifier annotation allows for more fine-grained control over bean resolution by specifying a qualifier value, whereas @Primary is a broader mechanism to indicate a default or primary bean when no specific qualifier is provided.

### Why is the @Required annotation used?
</summary>
I apologize for the confusion, but the @Required annotation is not part of the Spring Framework starting from version 3.0. It was used in older versions of Spring to indicate that a bean property must be configured with a value.

In earlier versions of Spring, the @Required annotation was used to enforce that a particular bean property must be set, either through XML configuration or through Java-based configuration. If a property marked with @Required was not set, Spring would throw an exception during initialization.

However, starting from Spring 3.0, the @Required annotation was deprecated and is no longer necessary. Instead, Spring introduced support for constructor injection and the @Autowired annotation, which automatically handles dependency injection without the need for an additional annotation like @Required.

In modern versions of Spring, you can use the @Autowired annotation on constructor parameters or directly on properties and methods to indicate that dependency injection should be performed. If a dependency is not satisfied or cannot be resolved, Spring will throw an exception indicating the issue during the application context initialization process.

To summarize, the @Required annotation was used in older versions of Spring to enforce that a bean property must be set, but it has been deprecated and is no longer needed in current versions of the framework. The preferred approach is to use @Autowired for dependency injection and let Spring handle the configuration and resolution of dependencies.

### What is the purpose of @Autowired annotation?
</summary>
The @Autowired annotation is an important annotation in the Spring Framework that is used for automatic dependency injection. Its purpose is to automatically wire or inject dependencies into a Spring-managed bean.

When a class is annotated with @Autowired, Spring will try to find a matching dependency of the required type from the application context and inject it into the annotated field, constructor, or method parameter.

The @Autowired annotation can be used in the following ways:

### 1. Field Injection:
```
@Autowired
private DependencyType dependency;
```
### 2. Constructor Injection:
```
private DependencyType dependency;

@Autowired
public MyClass(DependencyType dependency) {
    this.dependency = dependency;
}
```
### 3. Setter Method Injection:
```
private DependencyType dependency;

@Autowired
public void setDependency(DependencyType dependency) {
    this.dependency = dependency;
}
```
When the @Autowired annotation is used, Spring will search for a bean of the required type in the application context. If exactly one matching bean is found, it will be injected into the annotated field, constructor parameter, or setter method parameter. If multiple beans of the same type are available, additional mechanisms such as @Qualifier can be used to specify the desired bean.

The @Autowired annotation greatly simplifies the process of dependency injection in Spring applications. Instead of manually wiring dependencies, Spring automatically resolves and injects the required dependencies, allowing for loosely coupled and modular code. It promotes the principles of inversion of control (IoC) and reduces the need for explicit configuration.

### What is the difference between @Inject and @Autowired in Spring? Which one to use under which condition?
</summary>
Both @Inject and @Autowired annotations serve a similar purpose of dependency injection in the Spring Framework. However, they originate from different frameworks and have some subtle differences.

Here are the key differences between @Inject and @Autowired:

### 1. Origin and Dependency:

- **@Inject** is a standard annotation defined by the Java Dependency Injection (JSR-330) specification.
- **@Autowired** is a specific annotation provided by the Spring Framework.

### 2. Package and Dependency:

- **@Inject** is part of the javax.inject package and requires an additional dependency to be included in the project, such as the Java Dependency Injection API (e.g., javax.inject:javax.inject).
- **@Autowired** is provided by the Spring Framework itself and does not require any additional dependencies.

### 3. Configuration Flexibility:

- **@Inject** provides a more standard and portable approach to dependency injection. It can be used in Java SE and Java EE environments, and it is not tied specifically to Spring.
- **@Autowired** is a Spring-specific annotation that offers additional features and capabilities tailored specifically for the Spring Framework. It provides more advanced dependency resolution and supports features like autowiring by name, by type, and by qualifier.

### 4. Qualifier Support:

- **@Inject** does not have built-in support for qualifiers. To specify a qualifier value for a dependency, you would typically use @Named annotation from the javax.inject package.
- **@Autowired** supports the use of qualifiers via the @Qualifier annotation to specify the desired bean when multiple beans of the same type are available.

Considering these differences, here are some general guidelines for choosing between @Inject and @Autowired:

- If you are working exclusively with the Spring Framework and want to take advantage of Spring-specific features and configurations, it is recommended to use @Autowired.
- If you prefer a more standard and portable approach to dependency injection, or if you are working in a Java SE or Java EE environment without Spring, @Inject can be used.
- When using @Inject, if you need to specify qualifiers for dependencies, you can use @Named from javax.inject or choose to use the @Qualifier annotation provided by Spring along with @Inject.

It's worth noting that in modern versions of the Spring Framework, both @Inject and @Autowired can be used interchangeably, as Spring has added support for the @Inject annotation and aligned it with the behavior of @Autowired. This allows you to use @Inject or @Autowired based on your preference and project requirements.

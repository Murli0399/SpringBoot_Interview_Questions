To create a Spring Boot application, you can follow these steps:

**1. Set up your development environment:** Ensure that you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download and install the latest JDK version from the Oracle or OpenJDK website. Additionally, you will need a compatible Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Spring Tool Suite (STS).

**2. Choose a build tool:** Spring Boot supports popular build tools like Apache Maven and Gradle. Choose either Maven or Gradle based on your preference and familiarity.

**3. Create a new project:** Use your chosen build tool to create a new project. If you're using Maven, you can use the Maven archetype spring-boot-starter-parent as a base for your project. Alternatively, you can use the Spring Initializr web tool (start.spring.io) to generate a project structure with predefined dependencies.

**4. Configure your project:** Open the project in your IDE and configure any additional dependencies or plugins you may require. For example, if you're building a web application, you would include the spring-boot-starter-web dependency.

**5. Create application entry point:** In your project, create a Java class with a main method. Annotate the class with @SpringBootApplication, which combines several Spring annotations into one. This class will serve as the entry point for your Spring Boot application.

**6. Implement your application logic:** Start developing your application by creating controllers, services, repositories, and other components as per your requirements. Use Spring annotations such as @Controller, @Service, and @Repository to define these components and enable Spring's dependency injection.

**7. Run the application:** Once you have implemented your application logic, you can run the Spring Boot application. You can run it directly from your IDE by executing the main method in your entry point class. Alternatively, you can build an executable JAR file using your build tool and run it using the command-line interface.

**8. Verify the application:** After the application starts, you can access it through the specified HTTP endpoints or by visiting the defined URLs in a web browser. You can also use tools like Postman to test your RESTful APIs.

This is a basic outline of creating a Spring Boot application. You can explore additional features and functionalities provided by Spring Boot, such as database integration, security, and caching, to enhance your application further.

## What is the purpose of @SpringBootApplication annotation?
</summary>

The **@SpringBootApplication** annotation is a combination of three annotations: **@Configuration**, **@EnableAutoConfiguration**, and **@ComponentScan**. It is a convenience annotation provided by Spring Boot to simplify the configuration of a Spring application.

The purpose of the **@SpringBootApplication** annotation is to mark the main class of a Spring Boot application. By applying this annotation to a class, it performs the following tasks:

**1. @Configuration:** The **@Configuration** annotation indicates that the class is a source of bean definitions. It allows the class to define and configure beans in the application context. In the case of **@SpringBootApplication**, it implicitly declares the class as a configuration class, providing bean definition capabilities.

**2. @EnableAutoConfiguration:** The **@EnableAutoConfiguration** annotation enables Spring Boot's auto-configuration feature. It automatically configures the Spring application based on the classpath dependencies and sensible defaults. It analyzes the project's dependencies, detects the available configurations, and applies the necessary configurations for the application to function correctly.

**3. @ComponentScan:** The **@ComponentScan** annotation enables component scanning in the application. It instructs Spring to scan and detect components such as controllers, services, repositories, and other Spring-managed beans within specific packages. By default, it scans the package where the **@SpringBootApplication** class is located and its sub-packages.

In summary, the **@SpringBootApplication** annotation serves as the entry point and configuration class for a Spring Boot application. It combines the functionality of **@Configuration**, **@EnableAutoConfiguration**, and **@ComponentScan** to simplify the setup and configuration of a Spring application. By applying this single annotation, developers can start building a Spring Boot application with sensible defaults and auto-configuration, reducing the need for manual configuration.

## What is the purpose of @RestController annotation in Spring Boot?
</summary>

The **@RestController** annotation is a specialized version of the **@Controller** annotation in Spring Boot. It is used to mark a class as a RESTful controller, specifically designed for building RESTful web services or APIs.

The purpose of the **@RestController** annotation is to combine the functionality of **@Controller** and **@ResponseBody**. By applying the **@RestController** annotation to a class, it indicates that the class is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests and returning the response in a format suitable for RESTful APIs (usually JSON or XML).

Key features and purposes of the **@RestController** annotation include:

**1. Request handling:** The **@RestController** annotation enables the class to handle HTTP requests and map them to specific methods. Methods within the class are typically annotated with **@RequestMapping**, **@GetMapping**, **@PostMapping**, etc., to specify the URL mapping and HTTP methods they handle.

**2. Response formatting:** The **@RestController** annotation combines the functionality of **@Controller** and **@ResponseBody**. It eliminates the need to annotate individual methods with **@ResponseBody** as it indicates that the return value of the methods should be serialized and returned directly in the response body. By default, the response is serialized as JSON, but it can be customized to support other formats like XML.

**3. RESTful API development:** The primary purpose of the **@RestController** annotation is to facilitate the development of RESTful APIs. It provides a convenient and streamlined way to create endpoints that respond to HTTP requests, handle data input and output, and communicate using the HTTP protocol.

**4. Simplified configuration:** Using **@RestController** in Spring Boot eliminates the need for additional configuration, such as specifying a view resolver, as it automatically configures the class to handle RESTful requests and format the responses accordingly.

In summary, the **@RestController** annotation in Spring Boot simplifies the development of RESTful APIs by combining the **@Controller** and **@ResponseBody** annotations. It enables the class to handle HTTP requests, automatically serializes the return values to the appropriate format (e.g., JSON), and eliminates the need for additional configuration.

## What is an embedded server in Spring Boot?
</summary>
An embedded server in Spring Boot refers to the capability of running a web server directly within the Spring Boot application itself. Instead of deploying the application to an external server like Apache Tomcat or Jetty, Spring Boot provides the option to include an embedded server within the application, making it self-contained and independent of any external server installation.

The embedded server acts as a lightweight servlet container that can handle HTTP requests and serve web content. It eliminates the need for manual server setup, deployment, and configuration, simplifying the deployment process and making it easier to develop and deploy Spring Boot applications.

Spring Boot supports various embedded servers, including Tomcat, Jetty, and Undertow, among others. These servers are packaged as dependencies in the application, and the necessary configurations are automatically handled by Spring Boot's auto-configuration mechanism.

When a Spring Boot application is started, the embedded server starts along with it, listening for incoming HTTP requests. The application's controllers and request mappings are processed by the embedded server, allowing it to handle and respond to web requests without the need for an external server.

The use of an embedded server in Spring Boot provides benefits such as simplicity, portability, and ease of deployment. It allows developers to create self-contained, standalone applications that can be run with a simple command or by executing the main class. The embedded server capability is one of the key features that make Spring Boot an attractive framework for developing web applications and microservices.

## Can we change the default embedded server to Jetty?
</summary>
Yes, we can change the default embedded server to Jetty in Spring Boot applications.

To change the default embedded server to Jetty, you need to follow these steps:

### 1. Add the Jetty dependency:
In your project's build configuration file (e.g., pom.xml for Maven or build.gradle for Gradle), add the Jetty dependency as a runtime dependency. For Maven, you can add the following dependency:
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-jetty</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
### 2. Exclude the default embedded server:
To avoid conflicts with the default embedded server (e.g., Tomcat), you need to exclude it from the dependencies. In your build configuration file, exclude the default embedded server dependency. For Maven, you can add the exclusion as follows:
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-tomcat</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
```

### 3. Customize application properties (optional):
If you want to customize Jetty-specific configurations, you can add them to your application.properties or application.yml file. For example, you can specify Jetty-specific properties like server port, thread pool settings, or SSL configurations.
```
server.port=8080
# Add additional Jetty-specific configurations here
```
### 4. Build and run the application:
After making the necessary changes, build and run your Spring Boot application. The embedded server will now be Jetty instead of the default embedded server.
With these steps, you can change the default embedded server to Jetty in your Spring Boot application.

## How are Spring Boot web applications deployed?
</summary>
Spring Boot web applications can be deployed in various ways, depending on the specific deployment requirements and preferences. Here are some common deployment options for Spring Boot web applications:

### 1. Standalone JAR:
One of the key features of Spring Boot is the ability to create executable JAR files. You can build a standalone JAR file that includes all the application dependencies and an embedded server (such as Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow). This JAR file can be executed directly using the java -jar command, and the application will start the embedded server and serve the web content.

### 2. Traditional WAR file deployment:
If you prefer to deploy the Spring Boot application as a traditional WAR (Web Application Archive) file, you can configure the application to create a deployable WAR file instead of an executable JAR. This allows you to deploy the WAR file to a standalone servlet container like Apache Tomcat, Jetty, or others.

### 3. Cloud platforms and PaaS providers:
Spring Boot applications are well-suited for deployment on various cloud platforms and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) providers. Cloud providers like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and Heroku offer specific deployment options and integrations for Spring Boot applications. These platforms provide streamlined deployment processes, scalability, and management capabilities for your applications.

### 4. Containerization with Docker:
Spring Boot applications can be packaged as Docker containers, providing a consistent and portable deployment environment. By creating a Docker image of your application, you can run it in any environment that supports Docker containers, including local development environments, on-premises servers, or cloud-based container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.

### 5. Serverless deployment:
With the rise of serverless computing, it is also possible to deploy Spring Boot applications as serverless functions. Platforms like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions allow you to package and deploy Spring Boot applications as individual functions that can be triggered by specific events.

These deployment options offer flexibility and cater to different deployment scenarios. Spring Boot's ease of configuration and self-contained nature make it adaptable to a wide range of deployment environments, whether it's a standalone server, cloud platform, container, or serverless architecture.

## What is Spring Boot Dependency Management?
</summary>
Spring Boot Dependency Management is a feature that simplifies the management of dependencies in a Spring Boot application. It provides a curated list of dependencies, known as starters, which encapsulate common sets of dependencies required for specific functionalities, such as web development, data access, security, testing, and more.

With Spring Boot Dependency Management, you no longer need to manually specify and manage individual dependency versions in your project. Instead, you declare the starters as dependencies in your project's build configuration file (e.g., pom.xml for Maven or build.gradle for Gradle), and Spring Boot takes care of managing the versions and transitive dependencies.

By leveraging the starters provided by Spring Boot, you ensure that all dependencies are compatible and work seamlessly together. Spring Boot Dependency Management ensures that the selected starters are consistent and tested as a whole, reducing the risk of version conflicts and compatibility issues.

Additionally, Spring Boot Dependency Management allows you to override specific dependency versions if needed. This gives you the flexibility to use a different version of a dependency while still benefiting from the managed versions of other dependencies.

In summary, Spring Boot Dependency Management simplifies the management of dependencies by providing curated starters and handling version management automatically. It ensures compatibility, reduces conflicts, and simplifies the configuration process, allowing developers to focus more on application development rather than managing dependencies.

## What happens when a web application is run using Spring Boot?
</summary>
When a web application is run using Spring Boot, several key steps are executed to initialize and start the application. Here's an overview of what happens:

**1. Application Startup:** The Spring Boot application starts by executing the main method in the designated main class, typically annotated with **@SpringBootApplication**. This class serves as the entry point for the application.

**2. Auto-configuration:** Spring Boot's auto-configuration feature analyzes the classpath and dependencies to automatically configure the application. It detects the presence of various libraries and frameworks and applies sensible defaults and configurations based on conventions.

**3. Embedded Server Initialization:** If the application includes an embedded server (such as Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow), it is initialized and started. The embedded server provides the runtime environment for the application to handle incoming HTTP requests and serve responses.

**4. Component Scanning:** Spring Boot scans the application's packages and sub-packages to identify components such as controllers, services, repositories, and other Spring-managed beans. It uses component scanning annotations like **@Component**, **@RestController**, **@Service**, etc., to detect and register these components in the application context.

**5. Bean Creation and Dependency Injection:** Spring Boot creates instances of the detected beans and manages their lifecycle. It performs dependency injection, injecting dependencies into beans based on their configurations and annotations (e.g., @Autowired).

**6. Request Mapping and Handling:** Spring Boot maps incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate controllers and methods based on annotations like **@RequestMapping**, **@GetMapping**, **@PostMapping**, etc. The controllers process the requests, execute business logic, interact with services and repositories, and prepare the response.

**7. View Resolution (if applicable):** If the application involves rendering views, Spring Boot resolves the views based on the configured view resolver. It processes templates, combines data from the model, and generates the final HTML, JSON, or other view formats.

**8. Error Handling and Exception Resolution:** Spring Boot handles exceptions and errors that occur during request processing. It maps exceptions to appropriate error codes and formats error responses to provide meaningful feedback to clients.

**9. Application Lifecycle Management:** Spring Boot manages the lifecycle of the application, including initialization, configuration updates, graceful shutdown, and other management operations. It provides features like actuator endpoints for health checks, metrics, and monitoring.

**10. Application Execution:** With all the components initialized and the server running, the Spring Boot application is ready to handle incoming requests. It listens for HTTP requests on the configured port and executes the appropriate controllers to process and respond to the requests.

In summary, when a web application is run using Spring Boot, the framework initializes and configures the application, starts an embedded server, detects and registers components, handles incoming requests, processes business logic, and manages the application's lifecycle. Spring Boot provides a streamlined and opinionated approach to web application development, allowing developers to focus on writing business logic rather than managing low-level configurations.

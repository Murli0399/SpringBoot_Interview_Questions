### What are beans in Spring?
</summary>
In the Spring framework, beans refer to the objects that are managed by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container. A bean is an instance of a class that is initialized, assembled, and managed by the Spring container. Beans are the fundamental building blocks of a Spring application.

The Spring framework provides several mechanisms to configure beans, including XML-based configuration, Java-based configuration, and annotation-based configuration. By defining beans in the configuration files or through annotations, you can instruct the Spring container to create and manage instances of these beans.

Beans in Spring provide various benefits, such as dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, and lifecycle management. With dependency injection, beans can be wired together, enabling loose coupling and easier testing. Beans can also be enhanced using aspects to add additional functionalities, such as logging or security, to the core business logic. Spring takes care of managing the lifecycle of beans, ensuring that they are created, initialized, and destroyed appropriately.

Overall, beans in Spring serve as the key components that make up the application, and the Spring framework handles their creation, configuration, and lifecycle management to promote modularity, maintainability, and scalability.

### What is the lifecycle of a Spring Bean?
</summary>
The lifecycle of a Spring Bean consists of several phases:

- **Instantiation:** During this phase, the Spring container creates an instance of the bean using the bean's constructor or a factory method.

- **Population of Dependencies:** Once the bean instance is created, the container injects the dependencies into the bean. This process is known as dependency injection, where the dependencies are resolved and provided to the bean.

- **Bean Initialization:** After the dependencies are injected, the container calls any custom initialization methods defined in the bean. These methods allow the bean to perform any necessary setup or initialization tasks.

- **Bean Post-Processing:** At this stage, the container applies any registered BeanPostProcessors to the bean. BeanPostProcessors can modify the bean instance or provide additional processing logic before and after bean initialization.

- **Bean Ready for Use:** After the initialization phase, the bean is considered ready for use. It can now handle requests and perform its designated tasks.

- **Bean Destruction:** When the application context is being shut down or the bean is no longer needed, the container triggers the destruction phase. During this phase, any custom destruction methods defined in the bean are called, allowing the bean to release resources or perform cleanup operations.

It's important to note that not all beans go through every phase. Some beans may not have any custom initialization or destruction methods, while others may have complex initialization or cleanup requirements. The Spring framework provides hooks and interfaces that allow developers to customize the bean lifecycle as needed.

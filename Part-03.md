  <summary>### What are beans in Spring?</summary>

In the Spring framework, beans refer to the objects that are managed by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container. A bean is an instance of a class that is initialized, assembled, and managed by the Spring container. Beans are the fundamental building blocks of a Spring application.

The Spring framework provides several mechanisms to configure beans, including XML-based configuration, Java-based configuration, and annotation-based configuration. By defining beans in the configuration files or through annotations, you can instruct the Spring container to create and manage instances of these beans.

Beans in Spring provide various benefits, such as dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, and lifecycle management. With dependency injection, beans can be wired together, enabling loose coupling and easier testing. Beans can also be enhanced using aspects to add additional functionalities, such as logging or security, to the core business logic. Spring takes care of managing the lifecycle of beans, ensuring that they are created, initialized, and destroyed appropriately.

Overall, beans in Spring serve as the key components that make up the application, and the Spring framework handles their creation, configuration, and lifecycle management to promote modularity, maintainability, and scalability.

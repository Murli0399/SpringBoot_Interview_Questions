## What is Hibernate?
</summary>

Hibernate is a Java framework that helps developers create applications that interact with databases. It's an open-source, lightweight, Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool. Hibernate maps Java classes to database tables and Java data types to SQL data types. It also provides data query and recovery facilities.

Hibernate has several advantages:
- Increased performance
- Database independence
- Auto DDL operations

Hibernate provides an abstraction layer, so developers don't have to worry about implementations. Hibernate does the implementations internally, such as:
- Establishing a connection with the database
- Writing query to perform CRUD operations

Hibernate implements the specifications of JPA (Java Persistence API) for data persistence.

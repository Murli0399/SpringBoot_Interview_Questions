## How does Spring provide DAO support?
</summary>
Spring provides DAO (Data Access Object) support through its Spring Data module.

Spring Data offers a set of abstractions and utilities that simplify the implementation of data access layers in Java applications. It provides a high-level, consistent API for interacting with different types of data stores, such as relational databases, NoSQL databases, and more.

To utilize Spring Data for DAO support, you typically follow these steps:

**1. Define a DAO interface:** Create an interface that declares the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations you want to perform on your data store.

**2. Extend a Spring Data interface:** Extend one of the Spring Data interfaces, such as CrudRepository or JpaRepository, to inherit the basic CRUD functionality. These interfaces provide generic methods like save(), findById(), and delete().

**3. Customize query methods (optional):** You can define additional methods in your DAO interface that specify custom queries using Spring Data's method naming conventions. Spring Data automatically generates the implementation of these methods based on the method name.

**4. Configure Spring Data:** Enable Spring Data in your application configuration by specifying the data source and other required properties. You can use XML configuration or annotations, depending on your preference.

**5. Inject and use the DAO:** Inject your DAO interface into other components of your application (such as services or controllers) using Spring's dependency injection. You can then use the DAO methods to interact with your data store.

By following these steps, Spring Data abstracts away much of the boilerplate code typically required for data access, making it easier and more efficient to work with databases in your Java applications.

## Describe Spring DAO support classes.
</summary>
In Spring, DAO (Data Access Object) support is provided through various classes and abstractions. Let's explore some of the important classes and interfaces related to Spring DAO support:

### 1. Repository Interface:
The repository interface is the central component of Spring DAO support. It is an interface that defines the contract for performing database operations. Spring provides different repository interfaces, such as CrudRepository, JpaRepository, and PagingAndSortingRepository, which offer pre-defined methods for common CRUD operations.

### 2. CrudRepository:
CrudRepository is a generic interface that provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It defines methods like save(), findById(), findAll(), delete(), and more. You can extend this interface in your custom DAO interface to inherit these basic data manipulation methods.

### 3. JpaRepository:
JpaRepository is an extension of CrudRepository that adds additional JPA-specific functionality. It includes methods for querying entities, managing relationships, and executing bulk operations. It also supports pagination and sorting of query results.

### 4. PagingAndSortingRepository:
PagingAndSortingRepository is another extension of CrudRepository that provides methods for pagination and sorting of query results. It adds methods like findAll(Pageable pageable) and findAll(Sort sort) to retrieve data in a paginated or sorted manner.

### 5. Query Methods:
Spring DAO support allows you to define query methods in your repository interfaces using a method naming convention. These methods should follow a specific naming pattern, and Spring Data automatically generates the query implementation based on the method name. For example, if you have a method named findByFirstName(String firstName) in your repository interface, Spring Data will generate the appropriate query to retrieve entities with the given first name.

### 6. JpaRepositoryFactory:
JpaRepositoryFactory is a factory class that creates instances of repository interfaces. It is responsible for dynamically generating proxy instances that implement the repository interfaces and provide the actual data access functionality.

These are some of the important classes and interfaces involved in Spring's DAO support. They provide a consistent and efficient way to interact with databases and simplify the implementation of data access layers in Java applications.

## What annotation is used to mark DAO in Spring?
</summary>
In Spring, the @Repository annotation is commonly used to mark DAO (Data Access Object) classes.

The @Repository annotation is part of the Spring Framework and serves as a specialization of the @Component annotation. It is used to indicate that a particular class is a repository or a DAO component.

By applying the @Repository annotation to a class, you are instructing Spring to create a bean of that class and make it available for dependency injection and other Spring features. It also enables Spring's exception translation mechanism, which automatically translates low-level data access exceptions into more meaningful and unchecked Spring-specific exceptions.

Here's an example of how you can use the @Repository annotation to mark a DAO class:
```
@Repository
public class MyDAO {
    // DAO implementation
}
```
In the above example, the MyDAO class is annotated with @Repository, indicating that it is a DAO component. Spring will then detect and manage this class as a bean, allowing you to inject it into other components and utilize its data access functionality.

It's worth noting that while the @Repository annotation is commonly used for DAO classes, it is not mandatory. In general, any Spring-managed bean can be used as a DAO, but using the @Repository annotation helps convey the intent and takes advantage of the additional features provided by Spring for repositories.

## What is Spring Data JDBC?
</summary>
Spring Data JDBC is a module within the Spring Data framework that provides a lightweight and database-centric approach to working with databases using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity).

Spring Data JDBC aims to simplify data access and reduce the amount of boilerplate code typically associated with JDBC-based database interactions. It follows the principle of "convention over configuration" and encourages the use of simple and straightforward mapping strategies between Java objects and database tables.

Key features of Spring Data JDBC include:

### 1. Entity Mapping:
Spring Data JDBC utilizes annotations and naming conventions to map Java objects to database tables. By default, it assumes a one-to-one mapping between entities and tables, with column names matching the field names in the Java class.

### 2. Repository Support:
Similar to other Spring Data modules, Spring Data JDBC provides repository support. It includes a CrudRepository interface and other interfaces for common data operations, such as findById(), save(), delete(), and more. These interfaces allow you to define custom query methods using method names or annotations.

### 3. Query Methods:
Spring Data JDBC supports the creation of queries using method names following a predefined naming convention. By defining query methods in the repository interfaces, Spring Data JDBC can automatically generate the appropriate SQL statements based on the method names, reducing the need for writing explicit SQL queries.

### 4. No ORM Features:
Unlike Spring Data JPA, which uses an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework like Hibernate, Spring Data JDBC does not incorporate any ORM features. It focuses on direct database access and avoids complex object-relational mapping. This approach can be beneficial for projects that prefer a more lightweight and SQL-centric approach to data access.

### 5. Transaction Management:
Spring Data JDBC integrates seamlessly with Spring's transaction management capabilities. You can leverage Spring's declarative transaction support using annotations or XML configuration to ensure consistency and integrity when performing database operations.

Overall, Spring Data JDBC provides a simpler alternative to traditional JDBC programming by leveraging Spring's features and conventions. It offers a lightweight and efficient approach for interacting with databases in Java applications while maintaining control and flexibility over SQL statements and database schema.

## What tasks are performed by Spring JDBC?
</summary>
Spring JDBC is a module within the Spring Framework that provides support for interacting with relational databases using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). It simplifies database access and offers several tasks and functionalities:

### 1. Connection Management:
Spring JDBC manages the creation, acquisition, and release of database connections. It abstracts away the boilerplate code for establishing and closing database connections, ensuring efficient connection handling.

### 2. Exception Translation:
Spring JDBC provides exception translation capabilities. It translates low-level JDBC exceptions into more meaningful and unchecked Spring-specific exceptions. This allows developers to handle exceptions in a consistent and unified manner, regardless of the underlying database technology.

### 3. SQL Execution:
Spring JDBC facilitates the execution of SQL statements against the database. It provides utilities for executing queries, updates, and stored procedures. Spring JDBC takes care of preparing and executing the statements, handling parameter binding, and processing result sets.

### 4. Named Parameter Support:
Spring JDBC supports named parameters in SQL queries. Instead of using positional parameters, you can specify named parameters in your SQL statements. Spring JDBC maps the named parameters to the corresponding values during query execution, making the code more readable and maintainable.

### 5. ResultSet Handling:
Spring JDBC assists in handling result sets returned from database queries. It provides various techniques to map result set data to Java objects, including row mapping, ResultSet extractors, and object mappers. These mechanisms streamline the process of extracting and transforming data from the result set into meaningful Java objects.

### 6. Transaction Management:
Spring JDBC integrates with Spring's transaction management capabilities. It allows you to manage transactions declaratively using annotations or XML configuration. You can define transaction boundaries around your database operations, ensuring data consistency and integrity.

### 7. Batch Operations:
Spring JDBC supports batch operations, allowing you to execute multiple SQL statements as a batch. This can significantly improve performance by reducing network round-trips and enhancing database efficiency.

### 8. Connection Pooling:
Although not directly provided by Spring JDBC, it often works in conjunction with connection pooling libraries. Connection pooling enables the reuse of database connections, enhancing performance and scalability. Spring JDBC seamlessly integrates with popular connection pooling libraries like Apache Commons DBCP and HikariCP.

These tasks collectively make Spring JDBC a valuable tool for efficient and simplified database access in Java applications, reducing boilerplate code and providing higher-level abstractions for common database operations.

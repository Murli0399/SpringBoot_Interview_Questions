## How does Spring provide DAO support?
</summary>
Spring provides DAO (Data Access Object) support through its Spring Data module.

Spring Data offers a set of abstractions and utilities that simplify the implementation of data access layers in Java applications. It provides a high-level, consistent API for interacting with different types of data stores, such as relational databases, NoSQL databases, and more.

To utilize Spring Data for DAO support, you typically follow these steps:

**1. Define a DAO interface:** Create an interface that declares the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations you want to perform on your data store.

**2. Extend a Spring Data interface:** Extend one of the Spring Data interfaces, such as CrudRepository or JpaRepository, to inherit the basic CRUD functionality. These interfaces provide generic methods like save(), findById(), and delete().

**3. Customize query methods (optional):** You can define additional methods in your DAO interface that specify custom queries using Spring Data's method naming conventions. Spring Data automatically generates the implementation of these methods based on the method name.

**4. Configure Spring Data:** Enable Spring Data in your application configuration by specifying the data source and other required properties. You can use XML configuration or annotations, depending on your preference.

**5. Inject and use the DAO:** Inject your DAO interface into other components of your application (such as services or controllers) using Spring's dependency injection. You can then use the DAO methods to interact with your data store.

By following these steps, Spring Data abstracts away much of the boilerplate code typically required for data access, making it easier and more efficient to work with databases in your Java applications.

## Describe Spring DAO support classes.
</summary>
In Spring, DAO (Data Access Object) support is provided through various classes and abstractions. Let's explore some of the important classes and interfaces related to Spring DAO support:

### 1. Repository Interface:
The repository interface is the central component of Spring DAO support. It is an interface that defines the contract for performing database operations. Spring provides different repository interfaces, such as CrudRepository, JpaRepository, and PagingAndSortingRepository, which offer pre-defined methods for common CRUD operations.

### 2. CrudRepository:
CrudRepository is a generic interface that provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It defines methods like save(), findById(), findAll(), delete(), and more. You can extend this interface in your custom DAO interface to inherit these basic data manipulation methods.

### 3. JpaRepository:
JpaRepository is an extension of CrudRepository that adds additional JPA-specific functionality. It includes methods for querying entities, managing relationships, and executing bulk operations. It also supports pagination and sorting of query results.

### 4. PagingAndSortingRepository:
PagingAndSortingRepository is another extension of CrudRepository that provides methods for pagination and sorting of query results. It adds methods like findAll(Pageable pageable) and findAll(Sort sort) to retrieve data in a paginated or sorted manner.

### 5. Query Methods:
Spring DAO support allows you to define query methods in your repository interfaces using a method naming convention. These methods should follow a specific naming pattern, and Spring Data automatically generates the query implementation based on the method name. For example, if you have a method named findByFirstName(String firstName) in your repository interface, Spring Data will generate the appropriate query to retrieve entities with the given first name.

### 6. JpaRepositoryFactory:
JpaRepositoryFactory is a factory class that creates instances of repository interfaces. It is responsible for dynamically generating proxy instances that implement the repository interfaces and provide the actual data access functionality.

These are some of the important classes and interfaces involved in Spring's DAO support. They provide a consistent and efficient way to interact with databases and simplify the implementation of data access layers in Java applications.

## What annotation is used to mark DAO in Spring?
</summary>
In Spring, the @Repository annotation is commonly used to mark DAO (Data Access Object) classes.

The @Repository annotation is part of the Spring Framework and serves as a specialization of the @Component annotation. It is used to indicate that a particular class is a repository or a DAO component.

By applying the @Repository annotation to a class, you are instructing Spring to create a bean of that class and make it available for dependency injection and other Spring features. It also enables Spring's exception translation mechanism, which automatically translates low-level data access exceptions into more meaningful and unchecked Spring-specific exceptions.

Here's an example of how you can use the @Repository annotation to mark a DAO class:
```
@Repository
public class MyDAO {
    // DAO implementation
}
```
In the above example, the MyDAO class is annotated with @Repository, indicating that it is a DAO component. Spring will then detect and manage this class as a bean, allowing you to inject it into other components and utilize its data access functionality.

It's worth noting that while the @Repository annotation is commonly used for DAO classes, it is not mandatory. In general, any Spring-managed bean can be used as a DAO, but using the @Repository annotation helps convey the intent and takes advantage of the additional features provided by Spring for repositories.

</details>
<details><summary>

## How are records from a database fetched when using JdbcTemplate?
</summary>
When using JdbcTemplate in Spring, records from a database are fetched by executing SQL queries and mapping the result set to Java objects. The query() method of JdbcTemplate is commonly used for this purpose.

Here's a simplified explanation of the process:

### 1. Construct the SQL Query:
Create an SQL query that retrieves the desired records from the database. The query can include placeholders for parameters, which will be populated later.

### 2. Define a RowMapper:
Implement a RowMapper interface or use an existing implementation to map each row from the result set to a Java object. The RowMapper defines the mapping logic between the database columns and the fields or properties of the Java object.

### 3. Execute the Query:
Invoke the query() method of JdbcTemplate and pass in the SQL query, the RowMapper, and any necessary parameters. JdbcTemplate handles the execution of the query, parameter binding, and result set processing.

### 4. Process the Result:
JdbcTemplate retrieves the result set from the executed query and iterates over each row. For each row, it calls the RowMapper implementation to map the row to a Java object. The RowMapper extracts the relevant data from the result set and creates an instance of the Java object, which is then added to the resulting collection.

### 5. Return the Result:
The query() method returns the collection of mapped Java objects, which represents the fetched records from the database.

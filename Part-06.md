## What is autowiring in Spring?
</summary>
In Spring, autowiring is a feature that allows automatic dependency injection. It enables the framework to automatically wire (or connect) collaborating beans based on their types. By using autowiring, developers can avoid explicit configuration of dependencies and let Spring handle the wiring process behind the scenes.

## What are the different modes of autowiring in Spring?
</summary>
In Spring, there are several modes of autowiring that determine how dependencies are resolved and injected. The different modes of autowiring are:

**1. No Autowiring (autowire="no"):** This is the default mode where no autowiring occurs. Dependencies need to be explicitly configured using XML or annotations.

**2. By Name (autowire="byName"):** Autowiring is done by matching the dependency name with a bean name in the container. The names must be the same for successful autowiring.

**3. By Type (autowire="byType"):** Autowiring is done by matching the dependency type with a bean type in the container. If there is a single bean of the required type, it will be autowired. If there are multiple beans of the same type, an exception will be thrown.

**4. Constructor (autowire="constructor"):** Autowiring is done by matching constructor arguments with the beans available in the container. Spring tries to find a constructor with matching argument types, and if found, it autowires the dependencies.

**5. By Annotation (@Autowired, @Inject, @Resource):** Autowiring is done based on annotations placed on fields, methods, or constructors. These annotations indicate the dependencies to be injected, and Spring resolves and injects them accordingly.

Each autowiring mode has its advantages and considerations, and the appropriate mode should be chosen based on the specific requirements of the application.

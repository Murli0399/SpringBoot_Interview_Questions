This repository is created for interview purpose, If anyone need to learn spring and spring boot-related questions and answers, follow this repo and crack interviews. 



## Diff between spring and spring boot?
**Spring:** Spring Framework is the most popular application development framework of Java. The main feature of the Spring Framework is dependency Injection or Inversion of Control (IoC). With the help of Spring Framework, we can develop a loosely coupled application. It is better to use if application type or characteristics are purely defined.

**Spring Boot:** Spring Boot is a module of Spring Framework. It allows us to build a stand-alone application with minimal or zero configurations. It is better to use if we want to develop a simple Spring-based application or RESTful services.

|Spring|Spring Boot|
|------|-----------|
|Spring Framework is a widely used Java EE framework for building applications.|Spring Boot Framework is widely used to develop REST APIs.|
|It aims to simplify Java EE development and makes developers more productive.|It aims to shorten the code length and provide the easiest way to develop Web Applications.|
|The primary feature of the Spring Framework is dependency injection.|The primary feature of Spring Boot is Autoconfiguration. It automatically configures the classes based on the requirement.|
|It helps to make things simpler by allowing us to develop loosely coupled applications.|It helps to create a stand-alone application with less configuration.|
|The developer writes a lot of code (boilerplate code) to do the minimal task.|It reduces boilerplate code.|
|To test the Spring project, we need to set up the server explicitly.|Spring Boot offers embedded servers such as Jetty and Tomcat, etc.|
|Developers manually define dependencies for the Spring project in pom.xml.|Spring Boot comes with the concept of starter in pom.xml file that internally takes care of downloading the dependencies JARs based on Spring Boot Requirement.|
